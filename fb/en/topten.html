<meta property="og:description" content="The Top Ten is well organized; on occasion you may find a Top Ten that keeps things cluttered, however, they know where everything is. The Top Ten is determined to make the right and best decision. If they make a promise the Top Ten will keep it. Top Tens are creative (and sometimes nutty) people. Top Tens can be hard as chocolate on the outside, but soft like vanilla ice cream on the inside." />
